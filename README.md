# Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation-Prediction

## Project Goals
The goal of this project was to analyze a hotel reservation dataset and employ machine learning to determine if a customersâ€™ cancellation can be predicted and how accurate would it be. My initial hypothesis was that the further in advance a customer makes a reservation, and the time of year would be the most likely predictor variables. 

## Process Approach
### EDA
 - Aquired a dataset from Kaggle.com that was comprised of over 36,000+ rows of data and was somewhat clean to start with.
 - Verified the source to confirm dataset was reliable
 - Looked for any domain knowledge that may provide more detail about the data contained
 - Reviewed the csv file to familiarize myself prior to starting my analysis to get an idea of what features I might be able to use to predict cancellation
 - Looked for nulls and missing information
 - Analyzed the distribution to see if anything was skewed
 - Compare variables and look for correlations to help support my hypothesis early on

### Model Selection
I decided to train and test the following 3 models:
- Logisitic Regression as it is faster to train but may not be able to capture complex relationships in the data so I wanted to see how it would perform with information that may not quite be linear
- Random Forest as it is robust, less prone to overfitting and very good with large datasets
- Gradient Boost Machines as it provides higher predictive accuracy but requires careful tuning to avoid overfitting

I found the three models to be good choices as I wanted to compare a more simplistic model against two ensemble models to see the difference in perfomance and benefits of each.
